# BulaBotSimulator
This folder contains a simulator of a robotic arm.
A video for the simulation illustrating how it works is available in the main folder.

The software was developed in Visual Studio with C++ and openGL.

Hold Shift left and press arrow keys to move the robot.
Press Crtl to open/close the grip.
Press Alt left to mirror the robot.
Hold Alt right and arrow keys to tilt the robot.
Press the Shift left and click on the screen to move the Robots grip to that location.
Click and hold the middle mouse button and slide to control the zoom.
Click and hold the right mouse button and slide the middle button to move the camera.

To learn opengl and c++ I truly recomend The Cherno youtube chanel. This code was based on what I earnt from it..

Future works:
Abstract the Robot arm to pace more than one robot on the screen. (TAB will change the current robot arm)
Hold box algorithm needs some change to pick the box while it is angled.
This algorithm will be linked to the eletronic repository (https://github.com/brunosdlima/Eletronics/tree/main/Servo)
